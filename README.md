I have implemented the entire backend of this website 100% by myself. I have contributed to approximately 20% of the frontend.

# Introduction:
The website is a freelance platform where users can have three roles: employer, freelancer, and administrator.
1. Users can view a list of all posted projects on the website and, if logged in, they can request to work on projects as freelancers or delete their previous requests.
2. Users have the ability to view comments and leave their own comments.
3. Users can view a list of projects based on categories.
4. Users can search for specific projects and see relevant results.
5. Users have the option to register and log into their user accounts.
6. User passwords are hashed.
7. Users can submit messages through the contact form, and their messages will be visible in the admin panel. They can also view the location on Google Maps.
In the user account:
8. As an employer, users can submit new projects, which will be displayed on the website after submission.
9. Users can view and edit their own list of submitted projects or delete them.
10. Each project has three statuses: 1. Undelegated and waiting, 2. Delegated to a freelancer and in progress, 3. Completed project.
11. As an employer, users can view the list of requests from freelancers for their projects and approve or reject them. They can also view the freelancer's username and resume page.
12. Freelancers can view the status of their requests, which have three states: 1. Pending approval or rejection, 2. Rejected request, 3. Approved request.
